# Randomiz - Randomness is easy now!

A lightweight JavaScript utility library for generating random numbers, selecting random elements, and shuffling arrays. This module provides commonly used randomization utilities to simplify your code.

## Introduction

This library includes utility functions for:
- Generating with flexibility random numbers.
- Random stuff on arrays.

## Features

- **Simple and lightweight**: Minimal code, no dependencies. [No more features, what were you waiting from a ranomness library?]

- `randFloor(a,b)` , `randInt(a,b)` , `randBytes(n)` , `randBits(n)` → **get random numbers/arrays**

- `shuffle(l)` , `choice(l,count)`  , `pick(l)` , `pickPop(l)`  → **random tools on arrays** (strings are converted to 1-char arrays)
  


These functions are useful for game development, data sampling, and other scenarios requiring randomness.

## Installation

Add the library to your project by copying the code or using a package manager.

Simply use `randomiz = require('randomiz')` or `import randomiz from 'randomiz'`
